hey another fun project i made 
in this project i used docker ,aws , prometheus, grafana ,linux and of course the most important wordpress
in the beggining i used docker in linux to make wordpress server .

Step 1 
the first thing i did was switching to root acount , after this i did yum update (i used centos 7 in oracle vm)
and now i need to install docker and docker-compose.
"yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2"
now congifure docker
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
install docker 
yum install docker-ce
add your user do docker (unless you are root)
usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
start and enable docker service
systemctl enable docker.service
systemctl start docker.service

Step 2
now for docker-compose
yum install epel-release
yum install -y python-pip
pip install docker-compose
yum upgrade python*
after this i had docker and docker-compose on my linux system

Step 3
and now i want to setup wordpress server (check docker-compose file in this directory)
docker-compose up -d (this file will be here in this directory).
all up no errors 
then i need to check my server is really working
so im going to enter my web broswer to "http://my-ip"
to find your ip go to ifconfig
and then you can setup your wordpress 
that was the first step  , creating wordpress server with mysql as database in linux (not really the first step).

Step 4
the second part is converting it to aws instance
so first im going to launch my aws ec2 instance. (im using linux amazon ami 2)
make sure you have the following inbound rules
Http source anywhere
custom tcp port 3000 only from your ip
https source anywhere
custom tcp 9090 only from your ip
custom tcp 9323 only from your ip
and again i need to install docker + docker-compose 
sudo su (to become root)
amazon-linux-extras install docker
start docker service
service docker start
add your deafult user to docker group
usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
make docker auto start 
chkconfig docker on
and now reboot your ec2 instance.

Step5
so now we want to tranfser our files
first what we need to do is to get rid of the "key pair" in ec2 instance 
because we want to use scp and we cant use it if we dont got the pair key
so enter your ec2 istance  
sudo su
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config (we want to disable )
you need to change the following things or enabling them
PermitRootLogin yes
Port 22
PasswordAuthentication yes
you need to set password for ur root 
passwd 
and do password for your root
service ssh restart
now you can use ssh or scp without keypair.

Step 6
enter your linux vm (keep your ec2 instance open)
grab both of your containers names (mysql and wordpress) by doing  docker container ls
and now you need to zip them by doing 
docker export container-name | gzip > container-name.gz
now you need to do scp
enter your container.gz path
scp -i container-name.gz root@your-ec2-instace-ip /tmp/
make sure to scp into /tmp that's the only directoty you can copy to it 
move to where you want 
and then unzip it 
zcat container-name.gz | docker import - container-name
and then you can do docker start container-name
after this you connect to your website by using your ipv4 instance

Step 7
now we want to install grafana 
we do docker pull grafana/grafana
now if you go to "ipv4-instance:3000" you can see your grafana dashboard 

Step 8
configuring promtheus (file will be in this folder)
docker-compose up -d 

Step 9 
the end , now the final thing we want to do we want to enter prometheus and copy what we want into grafana 
this is the final result
