hello this is one of my projects that i made and it was fun and i learned a lot . 
i first created docker container on my linux oracle vm machine, creating wordpress server with my sql.
then i had to convert it to an aws docker container (using scp) , after this i installed prometheus
so i can have graph for my docker container and then i installed grafana for more beatiful ui
that's my wordpress website : 18.195.137.76
and that's my grafana dashboard
